# Current verification and implementation status

> **Category: CURRENT.** Single owner of live checkpoint results. Updated 2026-10-07 (Asia/Saigon); manifests/logs remain primary evidence.

## At a glance

| Claim | Latest applicable evidence | Result / scope |
|---|---|---|
| Seven-group regression | [arch_final_20261007](../../tests/full_rtl/evidence/arch_final_20261007/results.json) | PASS; all 41 RTL/LUT hashes match workspace; seven synthetic groups |
| Synthetic graph | Same regression | 840,053 compute clocks; two prompt IDs, three generated IDs, 16 layer executions; numeric/causal/traffic checks retained |
| Portable elaboration | [portable_arch_20261007](portable_arch_20261007/results.json) | ELABORATION_PASS; matching RTL; zero errors/warnings; vendor-free `run 0`, not ASIC signoff |
| Synthesis / fit | [arch_fulltop2_20261007](timing/arch_fulltop2_20261007/manifest.json) | Both completed with zero errors; 22 map warnings, four fit warnings |
| All-corner timing at 100 MHz | Same timing manifest | FAIL; minimum Fmax 95.61 MHz; worst setup −0.459 ns / TNS −3.266 ns at slow 85°C |
| Other timing checks | Same timing manifest | Hold/recovery/removal/pulse nonnegative at all four corners; zero unconstrained paths/clocks/ports |
| Resources | Same fitted checkpoint | 59,720 ALMs; 66,945 registers; 1,186 RAM blocks; 9,516,544 memory bits; zero DSPs |
| Host cancellation | No fresh dedicated archive established here | Earlier `opt_host1` is historical; do not claim its hashes match changed RTL |
| Pretrained application | No matching completed application result found | Current timing gate fails; no current application PASS established |

Raw RTL hashes were compared directly for regression, portable and timing evidence. All three QPF/QSF/SDC hashes match the timing manifest under its declared LF normalization. Timing manifest recorded 2026-10-07T11:07:17Z. STA completed with zero errors and one warning. Separate stage completion from timing closure and application validation.

## Latest implementation checkpoint

P0 greedy selection bypasses noise/sample states at zero temperature while retaining exact score selection and one PRNG advance per vocabulary row. P1 starts at most one next linear row during the current scalar/store tail, retaining ordered accumulator/fault completion and drain/reset behavior. See [implementation rationale](../../review/architecture_optimization_20261007.md).

Measured synthetic graph clocks decreased from the 2026-10-06 baseline 1,066,965 to 840,053 (21.27%). Linear phases decreased from 611,168 to 408,832; head from 365,661 to 341,085. Traffic remains 77,756 parameter reads, 1,828 vector reads, 1,564 vector writes, 320 KV reads and 128 KV writes.

The first fit, [arch_fulltop1_20261007](timing/arch_fulltop1_20261007/manifest.json), reached 101.53 MHz with setup +0.151 ns but failed reset recovery (−0.045 ns). Restoring the baseline reset-register site corrected recovery in the second fit but setup now fails on `vector_q[398]~DUPLICATE` → `input_cache_q[7][398]`. The implementation decision remains REVISE pending review; no further RTL or placement change was made by the documentation refactor.

## Historical comparisons

[Throughput review v3](../reviews/rtl_change_review_v3.md) records the earlier `opt_final4`/`opt_fulltop7` snapshot. [NanoFable timing snapshot](nanofable_max_20261006.md) records that earlier source/configuration, not current timing or application results. Preserved fail/canceled/intermediate evidence must not be promoted to current PASS.

## Verification and application gate

[Verification procedure and gate](README.md#pretrained-application-gate) owns the requirements. [Language demo](../demos/language.md) owns execution commands. Keep the 100 MHz constraints and report measured Fmax even when timing fails. Quartus evidence is FPGA implementation evidence only.
